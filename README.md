# Soda Monokai Theme

A fork of the wonderful Soda theme using Monokai colors. It's a work in progress and does not yet cover everything.

## Design

## Installation

Soda Monokai theme is designed to work with the latest [development build](http://www.sublimetext.com/dev) of Sublime Text 2.

### Using Git

Alternatively, if you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area.

You can locate your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/kraftwer1/soda-monokai-theme/ "Theme - Soda Monokai"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Soda`
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text 2 to use the theme:

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Soda Monokai.sublime-theme"`

### Example User Settings

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme"
    }

## Additional Features

### Retina Resolution UI

Soda Monokai does not yet support retina displays.

### Theme Customisation

Sublime Text 2 provides an elegant way to tweak existing themes without having to duplicate or maintain a separate copy of the original theme. If there are aspects of Soda Theme that you would like to adjust, take a look at the [theme customisation](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/wiki/Theme-customisation) wiki page.

## Bonus Options

### Syntax Highlighting Colour Schemes

The Soda Monokai screenshot uses the Sublime Test 2's Monokai scheme.

## Development

Please note, Sublime Text dev builds move quickly and changes can occur with the theme API between releases, so there may be occasions where the theme doesn't quite work with a brand new dev release.

While developing the theme, I have documented some [theme challenges and ideas](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/wiki/Theme-challenges-and-ideas) encountered along the way.
